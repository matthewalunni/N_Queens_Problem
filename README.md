# N-Queens Problem
- This is an implementation of the N-Queens Problem using a blind and heuristic search.
- The N-Queens problem is the problem of placing a variable N amount of chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.
- In this application, you can use either blind or heuristic searches to find all of the potential combinations. 
- In this application, you may select the number of queens you wish to see on the board.
